## Currently working on:
1. Stackfish-I (a chess bot and website that definitley does not have any relation in its name with Stockfish)
2. An encrypor and decryptor site for uses that I have not found yet
3. An aviation photography site (recrated and improved version of [Griff's Aviation Photography](https://sites.google.com/view/griffsaviationphotography/home)

## What languages do I use?
I mainly use JavaScript, HTML, CSS and JSON. If C++ or Bash would be more practical, I can use those to some extent.
